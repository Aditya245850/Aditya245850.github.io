							<p>Recently, my family friends from India started their own business. My dad would spend his extra time helping them fix the bugs and issues that customers would report to them; however, it became difficult for him to manage all the complaints. They came in many formats, like video, voice recordings through whatsapp, screenshots of complaints online or through emails and it became hard for him to individually look through every complaint (especically the videos) and prioritize the most important ones. I saw this and got an idea, thus starting my work...</p>
							<p>Introducing Complaint Coordinator, the effective solution for this problem! Using the Google Cloud Vision, Video Intelligence and Speech-to-Text APIs along with OpenAI, every complaint is quickly summarized and categorized and stored in a PostgreSQL database under a unique user id saving incredible amounts of time parsing through every complaint manually. These complaints are then displayed in a priority graph using Plotly and the client is able to download full reports of all the complaints with additional sentiment analysis further aiding in prioritization.<p>
							<p>Im not done though! This is my first version! For this one, I focused purely on prioritization techniques to help my dad! In the future I hope to integrate more features, to name a few: A dashboard to monitor complaints in real-time, notifications for urgent complaints and a resolution tracker as well as use an Elastic IP from AWS or buy a domain from godaddy! </p>
